Objective
=========

This test tool performs XML comparisons of the reference BPMN files and those 
imported and re-exported by each tool. It aims to eliminate differences that 
are not significant to the semantic equivalence of the files. 

Running
=======

The easiest way to run the test tool is via Maven as it manages all dependencies
for you. 

1. Install Maven as described here: http://maven.apache.org/download.html
2. Clone the tools and test suite to the same directory as the tools, for example: 
    /Users/timstephenson/git/bpmn-miwg-tools/BPMN 2.0 XML Compare
    /Users/timstephenson/git/bpmn-miwg-test-suite
3. Run mvn test from the XML Compare directory.

Constraints
===========

This tool is still under development and it is possible that non-significant 
differences are reported. It is less likely (though possible I suppose) that 
significant differences are omitted. 

For now no assertions are made in the test (asserting that no differences exist
would simply ensure all tests were reported as failures). One future direction 
could be to create a baseline that asserted if the number of differences 
increased between different versions of a given tool or different versions of 
the reference models but this is not decided. 

Standalone executable JAR
=========================

Download JAR file from https://raw.github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-tools/master/BPMN%202.0%20XML%20Compare/bpmn20xmlcompare.jar
Run program by: java -jar bpmn20xmlcompare.jar PATH_TO_REFERENCE_FOLDER PATH_TO_TOOL_FOLDER export|roundtrip [outputfile]

Example:

java -jar bpmn20xmlcompare.jar '.\A - Fixed Digrams with Variations of Attributes\Reference' '.\A - Fixed Digrams with Variations of Attributes\Signavio Process Editor 6.7.5' roundtrip output.html
